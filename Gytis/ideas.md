decrypt code from morse code
end to end handshake/communication (will not receive code if third pi (pretending to be a man in the middle) intercepts)
get nfc module working and get pre-programmed code from card
one pi has encrypted message, another has decryption key

maybe make nfc password encrypted?

each pi has a set 'ability' / use case
e.g. one has access to hardware, one can partake in cryptography (encoding, decoding, etc.), and one communicates between the two

hints
corrupted log file (tells you what to do but slightly incorrectly)
